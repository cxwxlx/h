**Dogecoin Wallet**

It is a good idea to be in control of your coins, and to not keep them in an exchange for any longer than necessary. If the company collapses, good luck getting your coins back!

Light wallets should not be used by miners or those receiving payouts from faucets, as these large transactions can cause the wallet to slow down due to their size. They can be quicker to setup though and you don't need to store the entire chain. This one works in the browser.
